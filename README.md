## ⚠️ **Important Disclaimer**

**This is a conceptual proposal and technical analysis.** The triple merged mining protocol does not currently exist. While LTC+DOGE merged mining is real and functional, adding BELLS would require:

- Significant blockchain development work
- Community consensus across all networks
- Coordinated hard forks
- Substantial funding and expert teams
- Approximately 5+ months of development

All profit calculations are based on current market data and hashrates, which are highly volatile. **This represents advanced blockchain engineering concepts, not an existing mining product.**
